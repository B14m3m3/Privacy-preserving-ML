# Privacy-preserving-ML

Project created based on the paper Melissa Chase, Ran Gilad-Bachrach, Kim Laine, Kristin Lauter and Peter Rindal on Private Collaborative Neural Network Learning: [link](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6d25/5f6d3b99296545e435744a8745d085621167.pdf)

Privacy is added by adding some randomness to the gradient and limiting the amount of impact a single data point in the dataset can do.
The model was switched to a simpler model as some problems were encountered with the neural network framework.
